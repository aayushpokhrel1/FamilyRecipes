// src/pages/Privacy.tsx says, in public, "Each one is listed here because the app actually
// sends data to it". That sentence was FALSE IN PRODUCTION for about two weeks, and this test
// exists because of it.
//
// What happened: the AI import's primary provider was switched to Google Gemini by setting the
// MODEL_BASE_URL secret. docs/OPERATIONS.md was updated. The privacy page was not, and it still
// said, under the Google heading, that Google was used for sign-in only and that "nothing else
// on this site reaches Google" while every photographed recipe card was being sent to Gemini.
// Nothing in the codebase changed, so no test, review or type check could have noticed.
//
// THE TRAP THIS CLOSES, AND WHY IT IS SHAPED ODDLY: who receives a user's recipe is a
// DEPLOY-TIME decision (a Supabase secret), not a code one. So grepping the source for fetch
// calls cannot find the answer, because the endpoint is never written in the source. The only
// place in the repo that records the real provider is docs/OPERATIONS.md, which is why this
// test reads prose rather than only code. It is a weaker guard than reading the live secret,
// and it is the strongest one that runs offline in `npm test`.
//
// WHEN THIS FAILS, you have two jobs, not one: name the company on the privacy page, and bump
// PRIVACY_UPDATED in src/lib/legal.ts so the date stops claiming the old list was current.
//
// WHEN YOU CHANGE MODEL_BASE_URL, the honest sequence is: edit Privacy.tsx, add the endpoint to
// AI_PROVIDERS below if it is new, update docs/OPERATIONS.md, deploy the page, THEN set the
// secret. Backwards means the page is a lie for as long as it takes you to notice.
