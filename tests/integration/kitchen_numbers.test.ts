//
// WHAT THIS FILE PINS: a kitchen group can read its own throughput, and nobody else can.
//
// `kitchen.group_numbers(p_org)` answers an owner or a chef with the dish counts, the funnel
// and a row per site, and answers everybody else with `{}` rather than a partial payload, so
// a site manager, a cook or a stranger calling it over HTTP learns nothing at all.
// `kitchen.my_group_numbers()` answers the same three figures keyed by org id, one key per
// group the caller runs, and `{}` for somebody who runs none.
//
// EVERY FIGURE IS ALL-TIME. There is no window and no "last 30 days" anywhere in these
// numbers, so a test that sets up three dishes is asserting on three dishes and not on three
// dishes since some date.
//
// The functions do not exist yet, so this file is expected to fail until they do.
