 * host has to rewrite its own routes to its own entry, and if that rewrite caught the bundle

// Disallow everything, and NOT for the reason this comment used to give.
//
// It used to say the landing page called the kitchen app "in development", so an indexed app
// on this host would make that claim false, and that this file and that sentence would change
// together. The sentence changed on 2026-10-15: the landing page now offers the app and links
// it. The Disallow stayed anyway, on a different and better reason.
//
// THE REASON NOW: this host serves an APP, not content. Every page behind it needs a session,
// so the only thing a crawler can ever reach is a sign-in form, and indexing that earns
// nothing while making the sign-in page compete with enamelvault.com for the product's own
// name. The landing page is the indexable surface and it describes the kitchen in full.
//
// So lifting this is a real decision about how the product is found, not a tidy-up that
// follows from the copy change. Whoever lifts it should want search traffic landing on a
// sign-in form.
