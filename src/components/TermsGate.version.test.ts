// The second one is the problem, because that row is the only evidence that consent was given.

// failure mode is not ignorance, it is not re-reading. So this test fingerprints the prose and
// fails when the prose moved and the version did not.
//
// WHEN IT FAILS: bump TERMS_VERSION in TermsGate.tsx, bump TERMS_UPDATED in lib/legal.ts, and
// paste the hash the failure message prints into EXPECTED below. Three edits, one of which the
// failure hands you. That is deliberately slightly annoying: a terms change should cost a
// moment's thought, because it re-prompts every existing user.
