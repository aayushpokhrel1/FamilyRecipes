description: Sweep every doc for stale claims, route each fact to its one home, and cut bloat
---

Sweep the docs. **"Update the docs" means making them TRUE and keeping each fact in ONE place**,
not appending what shipped. Work through all of it, not the file you happen to have open.

## 1. Check the numbers against reality, never against the file

Run these and correct every doc that disagrees. A number nobody re-measured is the most common
stale claim here.

```bash
npx tsc -b && npm test
```

- unit test count and file count, from that run
- integration count: `npx vitest run tests/integration` (needs `SB_URL`, `SB_ANON_KEY`,
  `SB_SERVICE_KEY` from `npx supabase status -o env`)
- latest migration: `ls supabase/migrations | tail -1`, and what cloud has:
  `npx supabase migration list --linked`
- head commit and whether it is pushed: `git log --oneline -1`,
  `git log --oneline origin/master..HEAD`
- what production is actually serving: `curl -s https://recipes.enamelvault.com/health/version`
- edge function count and deploy state: `npx supabase functions list`

## 2. Route every fact to its ONE home

`CLAUDE.md` has the routing table; it is the authority, not this file. The short form:

| Fact | Home |
| --- | --- |
| What the project is, the stack, the doc map | `README.md` |
| Product truth, decisions, roadmap, what is deferred **and why** | `PRODUCT.md` (+ vault copy) |
| The visual system | `DESIGN.md` |
| Running, verifying, CI, deploying, monitoring, env traps, landmines | `docs/OPERATIONS.md` |
| A rule about specific code | a comment AT that code |
| A lesson useful on a DIFFERENT project | the Obsidian vault |
| The design of one feature | `docs/superpowers/specs/` |
| Current state: commit, versions, counts, what is half-done, what is next | `HANDOVER.md` |
| A dated narrative of what you did today | **nowhere.** `git log` holds it |

**Move, do not copy.** If a fact is in two docs, delete it from the one that is not its home and
leave a pointer only if a reader would otherwise not find it.

## 3. Hunt the bloat, specifically

- **`HANDOVER.md` line count.** `src/handover.budget.test.ts` fails over the budget. If it is
  red, the fix is to MOVE content to its home or delete history, never to raise the budget. It
  hit 1,365 lines once and began contradicting itself, and a superseded line caused real wrong
  work; it hit 715 on 2026-10-15, almost entirely narrative.
- **Explanations told more than once.** Grep a distinctive phrase from any long explanation
  across all docs. Keep the copy in its home, and let the others point at it:
  `grep -rn "<phrase>" README.md PRODUCT.md DESIGN.md CLAUDE.md docs/ HANDOVER.md`
- **The same thing described twice inside one file** (README had the kitchen pipeline twice).
- **A doc restating a rule that has a code comment and a test.** The code comment and the test
  are the real homes; a prose copy is the one that goes stale.
- **"Still open" items that are closed**, and closed items still written as open. Check against
  the code, not against another doc.

## 4. Verify a claim before you keep it

Three claims in this repo were false while being repeated in two files each: that `/terms` had
seven open gaps (closed), that a third party's email was readable at `e7a329e` (it is not), and
that the Potluck byline rule was pinned by a test (it was not, until one was written). **If a
doc asserts something checkable, check it in this sweep.** A sentence that survives a sweep
unverified is how the next session gets it wrong.

## 5. Report and commit

Say what was stale, what moved, and what was cut. Then commit the tracked docs. `HANDOVER.md`
and `PRODUCT.md` are gitignored: sync `PRODUCT.md` to the vault instead
(`Projects/FamilyRecipes/product/PRODUCT.md`), through WSL, with the content in a FILE rather
than on the command line.
