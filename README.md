# Family Recipes

A private, multi-family recipe vault. Families collect, organize, and pass down their recipes
with photos, story, and provenance. Each recipe carries a visibility flag (Private / Family /
Public) so an opt-in public recipe feed can grow on top later. A community of food lovers, built
family-first.

**Live at <https://recipes.enamelvault.com>**, with the pages that explain it at
<https://enamelvault.com>. The bare domain is the marketing surface and the subdomains are the
apps; all are served by the same Cloudflare Worker, which branches on hostname.

## Documentation

| Document | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `PRODUCT.md` | Who it is for, the product decisions, the roadmap, and what is deliberately deferred. Not in this repo: it is gitignored, because the roadmap is not something a public repository needs to publish |
| [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) | The Enamel Vault design system: tokens, type, colour, components |
| [docs/OPERATIONS.md](docs/OPERATIONS.md) | Running it locally, verifying, CI, deploying, secrets, monitoring, environment traps |
| [docs/superpowers/specs/](docs/superpowers/specs/) | Per-feature design specs, newest first |

`HANDOVER.md` is local-only and gitignored: it holds current session state, nothing durable.

Engineering lessons are **not** kept in this repo as prose. A rule about specific code lives as a
comment at that code, where it cannot be missed; the generalisable half lives in the Obsidian
vault (`Projects/FamilyRecipes/`), which spans every project. See `CLAUDE.md`.

## What it does

- **Multiple families per user**: belong to several, switch between them, and invite people
  with a link you can send rather than a code they have to type.
- **Rich recipes**: ingredients, steps, servings, times, tags, photos, plus a story and
  provenance ("from Grandma, adapted by Mom").
- **Easy entry**: a guided manual form, or AI pre-fill from pasted text, a URL, a photo of a
  handwritten card, voice, or freeform writing. The AI drafts; you always review before saving.
- **Optional ingredients and alternatives**: mark something optional, or as a swap for another
  ingredient. The grocery list buys one of a swap pair, never both.
- **Per-recipe visibility**: Private / Family / Public.
- **Drafts**: save an unfinished recipe and come back to it, including one the AI pre-filled.
  A draft belongs to its author alone and is never a row in `recipes`. A pending edit to an
  already-published recipe is a draft too: the recipe stays untouched until you publish, and if
  someone else changed it meanwhile you are told and asked, rather than silently overwriting.
- **In-family comments** and **Cook Mode**: one step at a time in big text, the screen kept
  awake, and the step itself is the tap target because cooking hands are rarely clean. The
  ingredients that step mentions sit under it with the amounts already scaled, the full list
  sits beside the step rather than on top of it, you can tick an ingredient off as you add it,
  and the step number is in the URL so a reload does not lose your place.
- **Potluck**: a signed-in space for other households' public recipes, with search, a public
  cook page per handle, and following. Saving a copy into your own vault keeps the original
  cook's attribution, and the copy survives the original being unpublished or deleted.
- **My Kitchen**: meal planning on a day-by-slot week grid (drag a meal's grip, or tap to
  assign), leftovers that fill a slot without buying twice, and a grocery list built from the
  plan, grouped by supermarket aisle and scaled to each plan item's servings.
- **The cupboard**: what you already have, so the grocery list stops telling you to buy it.
  Add staples by typing or from the ingredient catalog, and tag an aisle for anything the
  catalog cannot place, from whichever screen you noticed it on.
- **Sign-in** with a verified email address or with Google.
- **Moderator console** at `/moderation`: the report queue, an overview of site counts, and a
  roster with suspend, take down, grant moderator and delete. Visible only to a moderator, and
  the page re-checks that rather than relying on the nav hiding the link.
- **Public documents**, readable without an account: terms, privacy policy, cookies, and help
  (`/terms`, `/privacy`, `/cookies`, `/help`). The kitchen app has its own `/terms` and
  `/privacy`, a different product with different parties, and its own acceptance gate. There is no cookie banner because the app sets
  no cookies and loads no analytics, which a test enforces rather than a promise.

## Stack

- React (responsive web now; a React Native app later, sharing the same API).
- Supabase: Postgres, Auth, Storage, and Row-Level Security enforcing the visibility model.
- Four Supabase Edge Functions: `extract-recipe` (AI recipe structuring), `delete-account`,
  `notify-report` (emails the moderation queue through Resend), and `admin` (the moderator
  console's backend, which needs the service-role key and so cannot live in the browser).
- Cloudflare Workers serves the built frontend and, because a crawler never runs the SPA,
  everything a crawler has to see in the HTML: a self-referencing canonical and its own title
  on every route, per-recipe OpenGraph tags, a cook's own name on `/cooks/:handle`, the four
  public documents' prose rendered at build time and injected into `#root`, proxied preview
  images and avatars, JSON-LD recipe data, `/sitemap.xml`, and two health routes: one for
  the extract function, one reporting the commit the Worker was built from.

Designed for portability: **all data access is isolated in `src/lib/api/`**, and nothing outside
it imports the Supabase client, so moving to a self-owned Node/Express + Postgres backend later
is a bounded swap.

This repo builds **two apps from one Worker**: the family app (`index.html`, `src/`) on
`recipes.enamelvault.com`, and the professional-kitchen app (`kitchen.html`, `src/kitchen/`,
`src/lib/api/kitchen/`) on `kitchen.enamelvault.com`, plus three static marketing pages on
the bare domain (see below). The two apps share tokens, presentational components
and the auth plumbing, and share NO data: the kitchen's tables live in their own Postgres
schema and `supabase/kitchen_seal.test.ts` fails if either side reaches into the other.

### The marketing pages on `enamelvault.com`

Three static pages, served by the Worker from `public/`, listed in `SITE_PAGES` in
`worker/site.ts`. That map is the single source: the sitemap and the `robots.txt` disallow
lines are both generated from it, so a page cannot be announced without existing or exist
without being announced. Each `.html` filename is refused as a public path, so every page has
exactly one URL and that URL is its canonical.

| URL | File | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | `public/site.html` | The hub. Belongs to neither product; links to both pages and carries the rack of public recipes |
| `/family` | `public/family.html` | The family app's case, and its sign-up |
| `/professional` | `public/professional.html` | The kitchen app's case, and its sign-up. This is the kitchen's ONLY indexable surface, because `kitchen.enamelvault.com` is `noindex` |

They share `public/site.css`. Anything else they reference must be in `isSiteAsset()`, or the
bare host redirects it to the app host, which makes it cross-origin and the CSP refuses it
**silently**; `src/site.assets.test.ts` is the guard, written after exactly that shipped.

Four tests run over all three pages from a list: `site.a11y` (structure, distinct titles and
canonicals, no inline script, hub neutrality), `site.assets`, `site.tokens` (palette drift)
and `site.claims` (no claim the kitchen terms disclaim). **Adding a page means adding it to
those lists**, or it ships unchecked.

## Quick start

Docker must be running.

```bash
npx supabase start
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

Full setup, environment variables and the verify commands are in
[docs/OPERATIONS.md](docs/OPERATIONS.md).

## Roadmap

Shipped, newest first: the public documents and the WCAG AA contrast and labelling fixes ·
search-engine indexing (robots, sitemap, canonical, JSON-LD) · moderation, reporting and
takedown · save and fork with attribution · Potluck, the public feed (browse, search, follow) · public identity and
public cook pages · optional ingredients and alternatives · week-grid drag and drop · error
and uptime monitoring · verified email and Google sign-in · the cupboard and "cook now" ·
ingredient aisles · My Kitchen week grid · recipe enrichment and grocery scaling · My Kitchen
meal planning · v1 private multi-family vault.

**Live and offered: the professional-kitchen app.** A dish goes development, trial at
one site, group menu, with every revision kept, one version signed off, and an owner able to
publish the approved version to Potluck under the venue's name. It runs on its own host,
`kitchen.enamelvault.com`, and its own Postgres schema, both live as of 2026-10-12. Since
2026-10-15 the landing page offers it alongside the family app, through a sign-in chooser and
its own section.

It stays `noindex`, enforced by a `robots.txt` and an `X-Robots-Tag` header rather than a meta
tag alone, since the crawlers that matter never run the page. **The reason changed on
2026-10-15 even though the rule did not**; `worker/kitchen.ts` carries it.

Next: opening Potluck beyond signed-in users, which moderation and the public documents now
unblock, and then costs for the kitchen (yield, portion cost, supplier, allergens) in their
own sidecar table.

Later: LLM / entity canonicalization for ingredients, a family-editable ingredient catalog,
and a native app. Per-recipe link previews are already built, in the Worker.

`PRODUCT.md` has the detail, including what is deferred and why. It is deliberately not published here.
